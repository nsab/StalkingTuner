Installation
------------

To install libfap on a linux system use the normal procedure:

./configure [--prefix=/opt or other options]
make
<become root if necessary>
make install

For detailed installation instructions see the INSTALL file.


Usage
-----

Usage info is available at http://pakettiradio.net/libfap/docs/ . A local
copy of the docs can be generated by running doxygen with the attached
Doxyfile. When in doubt, see the fap.h header file directly.


But this code is horrible!
--------------------------

Yes, my first C program. And programming is not my thing.
